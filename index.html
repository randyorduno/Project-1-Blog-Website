        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome! This blog website is designed for all the Goalkeeper fans (or goalie...) all over the world. In these posts we will talk about our favorite goalkeepers and the amazing saves they have had during all season. I mean that's the
          reason why a team wins or loses a game, right? Its beacuase the goalie was able to do their job correctly or not. If they did... We end up with this amazing saves. One hand saves. Fingernail saves. And those are the kind of stories we want
          to share. Which were your favorite? What do you think the goalkeeper could have done differently. If these are the topics you like to hear then I invite you to stick around and dive into the world of Goalkeeping.</p>

        <h2>Guillermo Ochoa Was Unstoppable</h2>
        <div class="line-break"></div>
        <br>
        I would consider this goalkeeper as one of the Top 10 during these few last games. Many may assume that he hasn't done a great job latley but these previous games reveal otherwise. During the game of Monterrey vs Club America on Dec 26th, the
        rival team, Monterrey had 20 shots but only 6 of them were shots with a possible goal opportunity but Ochoa saved 4 out of those 6. Clearly the score could have been much worse for Club America. So even if they didn't win, it should be clrear
        for every one that we need to give credit to the man who did everything in their power to actually try and win the game. Let's review each of the 4 plays and that can help paint a bigger picture as to why he is such a Goalkeeper genius...
